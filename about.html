		<h3 style="text-indent:70px">Welcome to my website...</h3>
		<p id="abt" style="margin: 70px;">I am a begginer programer who is pasionate in shareing my knowledge when it comes to codeing. I belive that everyone starts somewhere, even if it means starting with absolutlely zero experience...which would be me. None of my direct family has worked with programming before, so it took me a while to find it and figure out what it was. But, once I figured it out, I felt a strong desire to learn everything I can about it. Since then, I have been dableing in multiple languages. My favorite language is Python (if you couldn't tell) which is a good beginner program in my opinion. Some other languages I have worked with include: C, Arduino, HTML, and now CSS. I also have a passion for cyber security and am working towards some certificates at the moment. Eventually, I hope I'll eventually be able to work for a larger company as a programmer of some kind. </p>
