        <h1 id="H1">Welcome!</h1>
        <h4 id="H4"> This website is for anyone who needs a little more help with any python fundamentals. This website will also teach you how to get started with various websites and resources! </h4>
        <img id="img1" src="PythonLogo.jpg" alt="Python logo">
        <p>Now lets get started...<br> The first step in coding in python is understanding that its just like any other language you would learn, like spanish or german for example. That being said, take the same aproach. You need to start by learning the syntax, or in other words the format/guidlines of the language. The syntax for python is simple and has a resemblence to english. Once you are able to understand the syntax, you are able to start to codeing!</p>
        <img id="img2" src="Python_image.jpg" alt="Python image">
        <p> To start coding you need to understand variables and data types. See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp">Data Types and Variables</a> for more information. Variables are values that have different types, for example a whole number is an integer or int and decimals are float. The program will automatically asign the type based on the initial value, however you have the option to asign in yourself depending on the situation. Variables can also be words, these are called strings. They can also be stored in a variable as a str(). Next you have booleans, which are basically true or false (1/0). Finally, with variables you have the ability to use operators, or in other words basic arithmetic (* / + / -).<br>See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">w3schools</a> for more information. </p>
        <p>Finnally, getting into the core of python we'll talk about <span class="boldtext"> lists</span>, <span class="boldtext">tuples</span>, <span class="boldtext">sets</span>, <span class="boldtext">dictionaries</span>, and <span class="boldtext">conditionals</span>.</p>
            <ul class="a">
            <li>Lists are multiple items stored into a single variable. They are changeable, ordered, and allow duplicates.</li>
            <li>Tuples are the same as lists except they are unchangeable.</li>
            <li>Sets are also the same as lists except they are unordered, unchangeable and unindexed.</li>
            <li>Dictionaries are used to store data in key:value pairs</li>
            </ul> 
        <p>Moving on, we have conditionals. Conditionals are exactly as they sound. They are <span class="italictext">parameters that must be met</span> in order to complete an action. To see the syntax and understand conditionals more visit <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp">Learning Conditionals with Python</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, I hope this has helped you get a decent understanding of the basics of python. There are so many more tools available and many more additions you can make to have complex and concise code. <br> Clicking the image below will take you to the main page of W3schools, the page that I have used for learing code and referenced throughout this website.</p>
